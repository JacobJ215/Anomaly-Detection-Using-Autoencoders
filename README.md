# Anomaly Detection Using Autoendoder

## Credit Card Fraud Dection

## Overview

### Business Problem

1. **Objective**
   - To assess if a transaction is fraudulent from the given credit card data
   - Learn from various features of normal transactions to distinguish fraud transactions better


2. **Machine Learning Problem**
   - Develop a machine learning model based on deep auto-encoders to learn distribution and relation between the features of normal transactions


3. **Technology**
   - Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Numpy
   

4. **Metrcs**
   - Metrics: MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy model in a scalable way so that business decisions can be taken in near real time in assessing riskiness of a transaction

6. **Approach**

   - Exploratory Data Analysis  
   - Data Cleaning
   - Build a base auto-encoder model using Keras
   - Evaluate and Tune the model 
   - Make Predictions
   - Serve model as API endpoint using Flask
   - Perform real-time predictions
